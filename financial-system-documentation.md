   - Implements both API and web scraping approaches
   - Manages authentication and session handling

2. **Processing Layer**
   - Transforms source-specific data formats into a unified schema
   - Normalizes transaction details
   - Performs data validation and enrichment

3. **Storage Layer**
   - Securely stores transaction data in AWS S3
   - Implements proper encryption and access controls
   - Maintains data versioning and backups

4. **Scheduling & Automation Layer**
   - Manages periodic data collection through AWS Lambda and EventBridge
   - Secures credentials via AWS Secrets Manager
   - Handles retry logic and error recovery

5. **Visualization Layer**
   - Integrates with AWS QuickSight for data analysis
   - Provides customizable dashboards for financial insights
   - Enables filtering and detailed exploration of transactions

The system also includes comprehensive monitoring and logging via AWS CloudWatch.

## Data Model

### Unified Transaction Schema

```json
{
  "transaction_id": "unique_identifier",
  "source": "financial_institution_name",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601_datetime",
  "amount": "decimal_value",
  "currency": "ISO_currency_code",
  "category": "transaction_category",
  "description": "transaction_description",
  "merchant": "merchant_name",
  "balance": "account_balance_after_transaction",
  "transaction_type": "debit/credit",
  "tags": ["user_defined_tags"],
  "metadata": {
    "source_specific_field1": "value1",
    "source_specific_field2": "value2"
  }
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

  - Data processing: Pandas, NumPy
  - AWS integration: Boto3, AWS SDK for Python
  - Authentication: OAuth2 libraries

### Integration Approach by Financial Source

| Financial Source | Integration Method | Authentication | Data Format | Update Frequency |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|

## Security Considerations

1. **Credential Management**
   - All API keys, usernames, and passwords will be stored in AWS Secrets Manager
   - Credentials will never be hardcoded or stored in configuration files
   - Rotation policies will be implemented where applicable

2. **Data Protection**
   - All data will be encrypted at rest using AWS S3 server-side encryption
   - All API communications will use TLS/HTTPS
   - Access to the S3 bucket will be restricted to the minimum necessary permissions

3. **Access Control**
   - IAM roles with principle of least privilege will be used for all components
   - QuickSight dashboard access will be restricted to authorized users only
   - Lambda functions will operate with restricted execution roles

## System Interfaces

### External Interfaces

- Financial institution APIs and websites
- AWS services (S3, Lambda, QuickSight, etc.)
- Notification systems (email, SMS)

### User Interfaces

- AWS QuickSight dashboard for data visualization
- Optional command-line interface for manual operations
- AWS Console for system monitoring and configuration

## Conclusion

This financial transaction aggregation system provides a comprehensive solution for personal financial data management. By centralizing data from multiple Japanese financial sources into a unified AWS-based platform, it enables powerful visualization and analysis capabilities while maintaining strong security controls.
